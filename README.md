# How to code a Transformer model for time series forecasting in PyTorch
## PyTorch implementation of Transformer model used in "Deep Transformer Models for Time Series Forecasting: The Influenza Prevalence Case"

This post in Towards Data Science explains how to code the Transformer model used in the paper "Deep Transformer Models for Time Series Forecasting: The Influenza Prevalence Case"

The post uses the Transformer architecture diagram as the point of departure and shows step by step how to implement the model with PyTorch.
